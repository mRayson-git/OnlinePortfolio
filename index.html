            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a second level computer programming student at Algonquin College. My passions lay with finding ways
                to solve everyday problems using automation through programming. Currently my interest is in data analysis, 
                and as you will see I'm tracking my spending through a python/mysql program to optimize my budget.
            </p>
            <p>I have a coop term coming this fall, <span class="empower">September 2020</span>, and would love an opportunity
            to demonstrate my skills.</p>
            <p>You can contact me at <span class="empower"><a href="mailto:mrayson5129@gmail.com">mrayson5129@gmail.com</a></span></p>

            <h2>Algonquin College </h2>
            <h3>Computer Programmer, <span class="empower">September 2019 - Present</span></h3>
            <p>Focused on Object Oriented Programming practices. Emphasis on Java with some scripting languages such as 
                PHP and JavaScript. Built web applications and created relational databases with the following DBMS:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>PostgreSQL</li>
                <li>MS Access</li>
                <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
                <li>Oracle DB</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="projects section" id="projects">
            <h1 class="empower">Projects</h1>
            <p>Currently I've got a few projects on the go. They mostly serve as learning aids to practice the concepts
                taught in class or experiments for topics that have not been covered.
            </p>
            <h3 class="empower"><a href="https://github.com/mRayson-git/CommandLineBudget">Command Line Budget Application</a></h3>
            <p>This project was inspired by a need for organization within my finances. Through it I can set budgeting
                goals on a monthly basis and track what categories my money is spent in. This project taught me,
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>an introduction into the Python programming language,</li>
                <li>database design and normalization,</li>
                <li>that money is a lot easier to manage when you can track where its going</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="empower"><a href="https://github.com/mRayson-git/OnlinePortfolio">Online Portfolio</a></h3>
            <p>This project was created because as I approach my coop term in the fall semester, I want to find more ways 
                to market my skills. This project taught me,
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>how to lay out a webpage with HTML and CSS,</li>
                <li>basic principles of designing a user interface</li>
            </ul>
