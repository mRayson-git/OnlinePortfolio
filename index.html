          <p>I am a third level computer programming student at Algonquin College. My passions lay with finding ways to solve
          everyday problems using automation through programming. Currently my interest is in data analysis which is driving
          me to work on my own budget application. You'll find more information on that further down.</p>
          <p>I have a coop term this comming fall, <span class="empower">September 2020</span>, and would love an oportunity to
          demonstrate and grow my skills. </p>

          <p>Heavy focus on object oriented practices, mostly with the Java programming language. Alongside my studies I worked on
          various side projects that helped me expand on the concepts taught in class. With the programming came additional courses
          on database design and management, in which I was able to gain experience with:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>PostgreSQL</li>
              <li>MS Access</li>
              <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
              <li>Oracle DB</li>
          </ul>
          <p>And with their respective development tools. I was also able to take advantage of a course focusing on web application
          development which opened up a world of possibilities for me. In this course we focused on the relationship between HTML, PHP,
          JavaScript and databases which combined with a Linux operating system create the LAMP stack.</p>

          <p>Nothing will beat the feeling of overcoming a problem when learning something new. For that reason I like to spend my time
          working on small projects that I can use to branch off from what is being taught to expand my knowledge in those areas. My first
          major project was inspired by a need to organize my financial situation. This led to the creation of my, </p>

          <img src="imgs/CommandLineBudget.png" alt="Image of budget application start menu">
          <p>It was around finishing that project that I started to learn about developing websites using html and while I knew I wanted to
          re-create my budgeting application as a web app I first wanted experience just working with HTML. Thats where this site came from.</p>
          <h4><a href="https://github.com/mRayson-git/OnlinePortfolio">Online Portfolio</a></h4>
          <img src="imgs/OnlinePortfolio.png" alt="Image of Online Portfolio webpage">
          <p>While this project had simply let me play with HTML and CSS, it was the basis for the creation of my new (work-in-progress)
          web application for budgeting.</p>
          <h4><a href="https://github.com/mRayson-git/WebApp-Budget">Budgeting Web Application</a></h4>

          <img src="imgs/transactionPage.png" alt="Transaction Overview Page">
          <p>This project is currently what is taking the majority of my attention at the moment. Its been leading me to dive deeper into
          PHP and the mysqli connector for what is currently a MariaDB database. Further information on these projects can be found on their
          respective GitHub repo pages.</p>

          I am more proficient in are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Java programming language => continue with a focus on it at school</li>
            <li>PHP => I plan most of the future projects I pursue will be web-based</li>
            <li>Relational Database management => data analytics has always interested me and so this is a skill I plan to further improve</li>
            <li>Python => This was the first language that I learned programming with, it will always be something I enjoy improving</li>
